ADDING:
"Add hard drive" simply adds the hard drive and it's contents to the database.
If you're backing up a drive, there's no need to do this because it will be automatically added.
After adding a hard drive, you can also add details on it's location by simply going into the drive's information dialog
and clicking "View/update location."

BACKING UP:
After a drive has been backed up, the destination drive as well as the source drive are added to the database.
The database keeps track of specific drive's backups as well. You can also edit the location once the drive has been backed 
up completely by searching for it and clicking "View/update location" in it's information dialog.
